## Data collection details
We cull about 33,000 superconductors with chemical formula and related critical temperatures from SuperCon (https://supercon.nims.go.jp/en/). After removing the duplicates and non-superconductors, we obtain 11,949 superconducting materials. More than 200,000 ordered and disordered crystal structures are collected from ICSD database. Then, we match 11,949 entries in Supercon with 208,425 entries in ICSD one by one based on their chemical compositions. In addition, the Tc values and structure data of hydrogen-enriched superconductors are collected from literature. Finally, we obtain 1,514 superconductors data entries that contain both superconducting transition temperature Tc and crystal structures. The reference.csv file contains the reference literature corresponding to the Tc values, and all data have been verified by scientists in the field of materials.
