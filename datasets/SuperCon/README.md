## Data collection details
We cull about 33,000 superconductors with chemical formula and related critical temperatures from SuperCon\footnote{https://supercon.nims.go.jp/en/}. After removing the duplicates and non-superconductors, we obtain 11,949 superconducting materials. More than 200,000 ordered and disordered crystal structures are collected from ICSD database~\cite{ICSD}. Then, we match 11,949 entries in Supercon with 208,425 entries in ICSD one by one based on their chemical compositions. In addition, the T$_{c}$ values and structure data of hydrogen-enriched superconductors are collected from literature. Finally, we obtain 1,514 superconductors data entries that contain both superconducting transition temperature T$_c$ and crystal structures.
